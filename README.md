# Bike Rental Ridership Prediction for Bike-sharing Systems Using Machine Learning
Nowadays, a bicycle-sharing system, a service in which a rider can rent a bicycle available for shared use on a short-term basis. The system plays an essential role in alleviating traffic congestion and noise in cities. In addition, the use of shared bicycles reduces air pollution as opposed to motorized vehicles in large cities.

For a bicycle-sharing program, the riders number greatly varies on any given day and hour. Developing an algorithm that accurately predicts the number of hourly riders can immensely help the program or the business owners by providing a more efficient management and cost-effective way. In this project, I applied different Machine Learning techniques to develop models that accurately predict the number of riders in any given hour of a day.
